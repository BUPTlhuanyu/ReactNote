# React ART

React ART is a JavaScript library for drawing vector graphics using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/).

It provides declarative and reactive bindings to the [ART library](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/art/).

Using the same declarative API you can render the output to either Canvas, SVG or VML (IE8).
